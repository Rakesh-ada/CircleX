Finality Thresholds and Fees
In CCTP V2, finality thresholds allow integrators to specify the level of confirmation required before an attestation is issued.


Finality Threshold
CCTP V2 introduces the concept of a finality threshold, which provides a chain-agnostic representation of the confirmation level for a given attestation.

In CCTP V2, each message specifies a minFinalityThreshold. This threshold indicates the minimum level of confirmation required for Circle's attestation service (Iris) to attest to the message. Iris will not attest to a message at a confirmation level below the specified minimum threshold. This allows applications to enforce a desired level of finality before acting on an attestation on the destination chain.


Defined Finality Thresholds
CCTP V2 defines the following finality thresholds:

Finality Threshold	Value
Confirmed	1000
Finalized	2000

Messages and Finality
Messages with a minFinalityThreshold of 1000 or lower are considered Fast messages. These messages are eligible for fast attestation at the confirmed level by Iris.
Messages with a minFinalityThreshold of 2000 are considered Standard messages. These messages are attested to at the finalized level by Iris.
Only two finality thresholds are supported. Any minFinalityThreshold value below 1000 is treated as 1000, and any value above 1000 is treated as 2000.


Fees
For CCTP V2 transfers, a fee is collected onchain at the time of USDC minting. Retrieve the applicable fee by calling the API every time before executing a transaction. Fees are subject to change with advance notice. See the table below for rates.

The maxFee parameter in depositForBurn specifies the maximum fee that can be charged during minting.
If maxFee is less than the minimum Standard Transfer fee, the burn reverts onchain.
If maxFee is equal to or greater than the minimum Fast Transfer fee, and minFinalityThreshold is 1000 or lower, the attestation is eligible for Fast Transfer. In this case, the Fast Transfer fee (which varies by chain) is charged onchain at minting.
If the attestation results in a Standard Transfer—for example, because maxFee is below the Fast Transfer fee or minFinalityThreshold is greater than 1000—the Standard Transfer fee (currently 0) is charged onchain at minting.
The minimumFee field in the /v2/burn/USDC/fees response represents the required fee rate in basis points (bps). To calculate the maxFee to include in depositForBurn, multiply this value by the amount to be transferred.
