[Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)](https://circle.com/cctp) is a
permissionless onchain utility that facilitates USDC transfers securely between
blockchain networks via native burning and minting. Circle created CCTP to
improve capital efficiency and minimize trust requirements when using USDC
across blockchain networks. CCTP enables developers to build multichain
applications that allow users to perform 1:1 transfers of USDC securely across
blockchains.

CCTP is accessible in two distinct versions, CCTP V1 and CCTP V2. Both versions
enable secure USDC transfers across blockchains, but they differ in
functionality and performance. CCTP V1 only supports **Standard Transfer**
constrained by blockchain finality on the source blockchain (about 13 to 19
minutes for Ethereum and L2 chains.) CCTP V2 introduces **Fast Transfer** and
**Hooks**, in addition to also supporting **Standard Transfer**.

**Fast Transfer** enables USDC transfers between blockchains at
faster-than-finality speeds, significantly reducing transfer times from minutes
to seconds. **Hooks** enhance cross-chain composability, allowing developers to
trigger automated actions post-transfer process. For more information, refer to
the [Hooks](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/generic-message-passing#hooks) section.

CCTP V2 operates with a distinct set of smart contracts and APIs, and will form
its own distinct network of supported blockchains as it is not backwards
compatible with CCTP V1 smart contracts. However, developers can effectively
stitch the two versions together under the hood to preserve a seamless UX and
offer greater accessibility.

[**Understanding the Problem**\\
\\

Blockchain networks often operate in siloed environments and cannot natively
communicate with one another. While some ecosystems, such as Cosmos, use
built-in protocols like the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to
enable data transmission between their appchains, direct communication between
isolated networks, such as Ethereum and Avalanche, remains infeasible.

Traditional bridges exist to address this limitation by enabling the transfer of
digital assets, such as USDC, across blockchains. However, these bridges come
with significant drawbacks. Two common methods, lock-and-mint bridging and
liquidity pool bridging, require locking USDC liquidity in third-party smart
contracts. This approach reduces capital efficiency and introduces additional
trust assumptions.

[**Design Approach**\\
\\
Copy link](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started#design-approach)

As a low-level primitive, CCTP can be embedded within any app or wallet - even
existing bridges - to enhance and simplify the user experience for cross-chain
use cases. With USDC circulating across a large number of blockchain networks,
CCTP can connect and unify liquidity across disparate ecosystems where it's
supported.

CCTP is built on generalized message passing and designed for composability,
enabling a wide range of use cases. Developers can extend its functionality
beyond just moving USDC between blockchains. For example, you can create a flow
where USDC is sent across chains and automatically deposited into a DeFi lending
pool after the transfer, allowing it to generate yield in an automated manner
using **Hooks**. This experience can be designed to feel like a seamless, single
transaction for the end user.

[**How CCTP works**\\
\\
Copy link](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started#how-cctp-works)

CCTP enables seamless and secure transfers of USDC across blockchains through
two transfer methods: **Standard Transfer** and **Fast Transfer**. Both involve
burning USDC on the source chain and minting it on the destination chain, but
the steps and speed differ:

[**Standard Transfer (Available in CCTP V1 and CCTP V2)**\\
\\
Copy link](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started#standard-transfer-available-in-cctp-v1-and-cctp-v2)

**Standard Transfer** is the default method for transferring USDC across
blockchains. It relies on transaction finality on the source chain and uses
Circle's Attestation Service to enable standard-finality (hard finality)
transfers. The process includes the following steps:

1. **Initiation**. A user accesses an app powered by either CCTP V1 or CCTP V2
and initiates a Standard Transfer of USDC, specifying the recipient's wallet
address on the destination chain.
2. **Burn Event**. The app facilitates a burn of the specified USDC amount on
the source blockchain.
3. **Attestation**. Circle's Attestation Service observes the burn event and,
after observing hard finality on the source chain, issues a signed
attestation. Hard finality ensures the burn is irreversible (about 13 to 19
minutes for Ethereum and L2 chains.)
4. **Mint Event**. The app retrieves the signed attestation from Circle and uses
it to mint USDC on the destination chain. For CCTP V2, no fee is currently
collected onchain during this step, but that may change with advance notice.
For details, see the
[CCTP fee schedule](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-finality-and-fees#fees).
5. **Completion**. The recipient wallet address receives the newly minted USDC
on the destination blockchain, completing the transfer.

**Standard Transfer** prioritizes reliability and security, making it suitable
for scenarios where finality wait times are acceptable.

[**Fast Transfer (Available only in CCTP V2)**\\
\\
Copy link](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started#fast-transfer-available-only-in-cctp-v2)

**Fast Transfer** is an advanced feature of CCTP V2 designed for speed-sensitive
use cases. It leverages Circle's Attestation Service and
Fast Transfer Allowance to enable _faster-than-finality_
(soft finality) transfers. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Initiation**. A user accesses an app powered by CCTP V2 and initiates a
Fast Transfer of USDC, specifying the recipient's wallet address on the
destination chain.
2. **Burn Event**. The app facilitates a burn of the specified USDC amount on
the source blockchain.
3. **Instant Attestation**. Circle's Attestation Service attests to the burn
event after soft finality (which varies per chain) and issues a signed
attestation.
4. **Fast Transfer Allowance Backing**. Until hard finality is reached, the
burned USDC amount is backed by Circle's
[Fast Transfer Allowance](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-faq#what-is-the-fast-transfer-allowance-in-cctp-v2).
The Fast Transfer Allowance is temporarily debited by the burn amount.
5. **Mint event**. The app retrieves the signed attestation from Circle and uses
it to mint USDC on the destination chain. A
[fee](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-finality-and-fees#fees) is collected onchain during
this process.
6. **Fast Transfer Allowance Replenishment**. Once the burn reaches finality on
the source chain, the corresponding amount is credited back to Circle's Fast
Transfer Allowance.
7. **Completion**. The recipient wallet address receives the newly minted USDC
on the destination blockchain, completing the transfer.

**Fast Transfer** is ideal for low-latency use cases, enabling USDC transfers to
be completed in seconds while maintaining trust and security via Circle's Fast
Transfer Allowance.

CCTP enables developers to build novel cross-chain apps that integrate
functionalities like trading, lending, payments, NFTs, and gaming, while
simplifying the user experience. Below are some practical examples of how you
can leverage CCTP in your applications, either directly or indirectly by routing
USDC behind the scenes:

[**Fast and secure cross-chain rebalancing**\\
\\
Copy link](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started#fast-and-secure-cross-chain-rebalancing)

Market makers, fillers/solvers, exchanges, and bridges can use CCTP to manage
liquidity more efficiently. By securely rebalancing USDC holdings across
blockchains, you can reduce operational costs, meet demand, and take advantage
of market opportunities with minimal latency.

[**Composable cross-chain swaps**\\
\\
Copy link](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started#composable-cross-chain-swaps)

With CCTP, users can quickly swap between digital assets on different
blockchains by routing through USDC. Users can also swap for USDC and
automatically trigger subsequent actions on the destination chain, enabling
seamless cross-chain transactions.

[**Programmable cross-chain purchases**\\
\\
Copy link](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started#programmable-cross-chain-purchases)

Automate cross-chain purchases with CCTP. For example, a user can use USDC on
one chain to purchase an NFT on a decentralized exchange on another chain and
list it for sale on an NFT marketplace. When the transaction is initiated, CCTP
routes USDC across chains to buy the NFT and opens the listing on the
marketplace—all in one streamlined flow.

[**Simplify cross-chain complexities**\\
\\
Copy link](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started#simplify-cross-chain-complexities)

Simplify the cross-chain experience by using USDC as collateral on one chain to
open a borrowing position on a lending protocol on another chain. With CCTP,
USDC can move quickly between blockchains, allowing users to onboard to new
applications without switching wallets or managing multi-chain complexities.
