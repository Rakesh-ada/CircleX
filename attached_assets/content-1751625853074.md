how it works

## Programmatic burning & minting

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67116d0daddc92483c812e88/67376c45e330ded4ef7abc93_Plane.svg)

###### Initiate transfer on source chain

A user accesses your app to transfer USDC and specifies the recipient wallet address on the destination chain. Your app facilitates a burn of USDC on the source chain.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67116d0daddc92483c812e88/67376c477b1277c3ab6f5f5a_Success.svg)

###### Fetch signed attestation from Circle

Circle observes and attests to the burn event on the source chain. With Fast Transfer, the attestation is available immediately. Your app requests the attestation from Circle.

###### Complete transfer on destination chain

Your app uses the attestation to mint USDC for the recipient on the destination chain. With Hooks, additional operations trigger automatically.

## Flexible pricing to meet your needs

No onchain fee for Standard Transfer. Fast Transfer provides faster-than-finality settlement with an onchain fee per transaction.

## FAQs

What is Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)?

CCTP is a permissionless onchain utility that enables the flow of USDC across chains through native burning and minting. With CCTP, USDC is effectively teleported from one blockchain to another.

Who is CCTP designed for?

CCTP serves as permissionless infrastructure for developers to build on top of, or integrate into, their existing apps, bridges, exchanges, and wallets.

CCTP V1 is intended for developers looking to integrate standard crosschain functionalities while CCTP V2 is intended for developers looking to integrate advanced crosschain functionalities for faster speeds and enhanced composability.

How does CCTP differ from lock-and-mint bridging?

Lock-and-mint bridges are applications that lock a user's native USDC within a smart contract on a source chain and then mint a wrapped or bridged form of USDC on a destination chain. This process incurs additional trust assumptions and can result in poor UX due to the fragmentation of liquidity.

In contrast, CCTP enables USDC to move securely 1:1 between blockchains via a native burn-and-mint process. The result is greater capital efficiency and unified liquidity with no creation of bridged forms of USDC.

As a low-level primitive, CCTP can be embedded within existing bridge apps to replace their lock-and-mint functionality.

How does CCTP differ from liquidity pool bridging?

Liquidity pool bridges are applications that hold large pools of USDC on a source chain and a destination chain in order to facilitate crosschain swaps for end users. This process incurs additional trust assumptions and fees associated with the liquidity tied up on each chain.

In contrast, CCTP enables USDC to move securely 1:1 between blockchains via a native burn-and-mint process. The result is greater capital efficiency and unified liquidity without the need for large pools of USDC tokens.

As a low-level primitive, CCTP can be embedded within existing bridge apps to replace their liquidity pool functionality. Alternatively, CCTP could be used by the bridge provider to programmatically rebalance their liquidity pools behind the scenes and reduce operational costs.

Does CCTP require signing up with Circle?

No, CCTP is permissionless, which means any developer can integrate via [our docs](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/circlefin).

What are the fees associated with crosschain transfers via CCTP?

For both CCTP V1 and CCTP V2 transfers, there would be a gas fee on the source blockchain and a gas fee on the destination blockchain. The app that integrates with either version would be responsible for determining how gas fees are handled and/or passed on to the end user.

For CCTP V2 transfers, an additional fee may be collected when the stablecoin is minted on the destination chain, based on the amount minted. Refer to the [CCTP product fee schedule](https://help.circle.com/s/article/Cross-Chain-Transfer-Protocol-product-fee-schedule?language=en_US&category=Fees_and_Billing) for more information.

‍

Is CCTP V2 backwards compatible with CCTP V1?

No, CCTP V2 will operate with a distinct set of smart contracts and APIs, and will form its own distinct network of supported blockchains as it is not backwards compatible with CCTP V1 smart contracts.

However, developers can effectively stitch the two versions together under the hood to preserve a seamless UX and offer greater blockchain accessibility until CCTP V2 reaches blockchain support parity with CCTP V1.
